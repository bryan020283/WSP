		<h2> Site Intent </h2> 
		<p class = "intent">
			The newly redesigned site needs to be far more efficient with an intelligent information architecture (IA) and attractive user interface (UI).  The site has many issues currently including the lack of an escape hatch.  While browsing the pages, I had to hit the back button each time to get to the home page before I could check out further pages of the site.  These goals can be achieved by using the production process learned in prior classes, and apply color schemes that work.  The site will be written with semantically correct code to reduce bulk and to streamline the code.  Also, maybe most importantly, the newly designed site will be created with a mobile first approach using responsive web design.

		<h3> Competitive Analysis </h3>

		<p class = "analysis">
			On the day this was written, the website for Truffles and Trifles was ranked:  4,738,315 globally according to Alexa.com.  26 other sites link to the Truffles and Trifles website which, in my opinion, is actually pretty good.  That also probably helps their SEO.  Over 40 percent of all traffic is from people searching for:  couples cooking class Orlando.  It’s a great option for couples and a good option to take a date on.  For these reasons, I will put a good amount of focus in those areas.  I want to drive in as much traffic as possible from couples to book as many classes as we can. 

			Looking at their schedule, I can see that most of the month’s classes are already sold out, so clearly they’re doing well.  However, I think we can do better.  I searched for:  “cooking classes Orlando” in Google and they came up number one.  So that definitely seems like a great area to grab business from.  In searching for cooking classes in Orlando, they actually seem to have cornered this market.  At first I thought they had competition when I found ‘Great Dates Orlando’ but that ended up being a site offering dating locations.  Guess who was listed first?  That’s correct, Truffles and Trifles.  So they seem to have a great product and great search engine results, but not an attractive website.  I would love to make the site more visually appealing so they can have that aspect of the market as well.  (But I’m not sure I’m at that level yet)  

			Also, the keywords they’re using are pretty good, but I will likely rearrange the order by importance.

		<h4> Targeted Audience </h4>

		<p class = "audience">

			As I previously mentioned, I’m going to target couples.  I’m going to target people in the dating world.  Online dating is very popular right now and men have to try and find a way to stand out from all the other men on the various dating sites.  One way to do that is to think of creative dates to go on.  This is a very good idea for a date because women enjoy cooking, and it’s a fun activity where two people can get to know each other and have a lot of fun.  It’s not like sitting in a dark movie theater and not even speaking to each other.  I could use a simple, top down workflow.  Need a great date idea?  After that I just lead into the details of why it’s such a great idea.   Then send them to book a date on the schedule!

			In addition to couples and people dating, I will also target just individuals who wish to learn to cook.  All kinds of people want to learn to cook for various reasons.  Maybe someone is a single parent and needs some help learning to cook for their child or children.  Maybe someone is married and neither person cooks.  They may want to be the one to learn and treat their spouse to nice meals.  I can use the same top down approach here.  Need to learn to cook for your loved ones or yourself?  Then move right into how great the classes are then send them to book a class on the schedule through a form.
