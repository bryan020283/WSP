		<p>Truffles and Trifles, located in Orlando Florida is the 
		cooking class destination of choice for everyone looking to learn to cook in their spare time.  Around 24 years ago
		we began as a way to share our passion to cook.  Now 
		we’re one of the largest and best cooking schools in the
		entire Southeast.  Our passion and dedication to excellence has served us well and when you take one of our classes you will experience the attention we put into every course.  
		</p>

		<p>In fact, Food and Network recently named us one of the top five cooking schools in the country.  The Orlando Sentinel says, “Long before there was a Food Network, Orlando’s amateur cooks looked to Marci Arthur for tips and techniques on the preparation of all things culinary – and a lot of advice on nonfood subjects, too.” 
		</p>

		<p>
		We want to bring out the chef in you.  Whether it’s a private session, a birthday party, a couples building session, a great date idea, anniversary, or any other occasion, Truffles and Trifles has the perfect class for you.
