	Truffles and Trifles has excellent programs for couples of all types.  Whether you’ve been married for 25 years and are looking for a creative way to spend your anniversary, you’ve been dating someone for months, or you’re taking a date out for the first time, cooking together is a fun, and unique way to impress and entertain your partner.  
	</p>
	<p>
	For the dating crowd out there, we have the way for you to stand out in the crowd.  One thing many people admire in a date is their ability to be original and creative.  How many dinner and movie combinations have they probably been on before you intrigue their interest with a fun and exciting cooking class?  You will likely earn great points by surprising them with this option.  Plus, there’s a bonus in it for you.  If you end up staying with the person you’re dating, now they know how to cook!  
	</p>
	<p>
	Or if you’ve been with someone for a longer amount of time, this is a great way to build communication, have a great time together, spice up the relationship, and reignite the spark!  
	</p>
	<p>
	Cooking together in class is also a great idea for anniversaries of all kinds. </article>
